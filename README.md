## Why?

I used Sapper a lot, but I realized that SSR makes things a bit complicated, and I would like to do things as simple as possible. To leverage this problem, I glued together the libraries I love into this starter pack.

## Try it: https://codesandbox.io/s/svelte-fastify-starter-ku9d9

## Try it locally:
Development:
`pnpm dev`

Production: 
`pnpm build & pnpm start`

(Or you can use npm/yarn)

## Includes:
- Svelte (ESM builds with Svite - similar to Vite for Vue)
- Routify (client-side routing)
- TailwindCSS (obvious, I think)
- Fastify (API)
